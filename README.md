# NeuroStack

> **AI + Full Stack Lab** — documenting my journey building portfolio-ready web applications powered by AI.

---

## Overview
NeuroStack is my personal development lab where I combine **full stack web development** with **AI integration**. The goal is to create real-world applications, experiment with cutting-edge tools, and document each step to demonstrate applied learning and problem-solving skills.

This repository serves both as a **portfolio for potential employers or clients** and a **living record of my technical growth**.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS (planned)  
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Redis (optional)  
- **AI / ML:** OpenAI API, Hugging Face, LangChain, vector search integrations  
- **Deployment / DevOps:** Git, GitHub, Docker, Render/Vercel

---

## Projects
All projects live under `/projects` and are documented individually:

| Project | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Portfolio Site** | React-based personal portfolio showcasing projects and skills | In progress |
| **Notes App** | Full stack CRUD app with authentication & Postgres backend | Planned |
| **AI Chatbot** | GPT/Hugging Face integration for Q&A and knowledge retrieval | Planned |
| **Additional AI Tools** | Future experiments and full stack applications leveraging AI | Planned |

---

## Roadmap
1. Build & deploy portfolio site  
2. Learn full stack CRUD apps with Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL  
3. Integrate AI into web apps (GPT chatbots, recommendation engines)  
4. Document all steps, code snippets, and deployment processes  
5. Curate polished projects into a professional portfolio for employers & freelance clients  

---

## Notes
- This repo is **public**, showcasing my workflow and code.  
- Each project includes setup instructions, sample data, and deployment links when ready.  
- NeuroStack is both a **learning sandbox** and a **portfolio builder** — expect experiments, refactors, and improvements over time.
